Programming Assignment 3: Linked ListsProblem ScenarioThe charity was very impressed with your work from last week. Nevertheless, the IT director at the charity just read his “Java Geek Weekly”, and discovered ArrayLists may not be the most optimal data structure to use. Thus, the charity has asked to replace the ArrayList you developed last week with Linked Lists.There was also some concern within the charity there were too many errors being allowed into the reports.They would still like the program to first run the report as you did last week, producing a report in the file: output/assn3initialReport.txtBut after that, they would like the program to validate the data in the linked lists, and clean them up. The charity would like the program to:o Check the Donor list for invalid email addresses, using the email validation method already developed for the Donor class If an address is invalid, remove the donor from the donor list, along with all of the donor’s donations in the donation list.o Check the Donation list for invalid check numbers, using the check number validation method already developed for the Donation class If a donation has an invalid check number, remove that donation from the list.o Write lines to the console, as it cleans the lists, indicating any actions taken to remove invalid data.Once all the data has been validated, the program should run the final report again, producing a second report in the file: output/assn3cleanReport.txt so the charity can compare the two reports.Program RequirementsThe program must follow the CS310 Coding Standards from Content section 1.9.This csv input file for this program will be called “assn3input.txt”, and will have the same format as the input file for Assignment 2.The Implementations from last week will be replaced with new implementation classes that will implement Linked Lists. So you will be modifying the implementations from last week, by removing the ArrayLists and replacing them with this week’s Linked List structures.The textbook described several types of linked lists, including: Singly Linked Lists Java Collection Linked List (java.util.LinkedList)Your DonorLogImpl will implement an ordered singly linked list, with a node class and methods you code.Your DonationLogImpl will implement a Java Collection Linked List.And to enable writing to different files, you need to add a filename parameter to the method that invokes PrintImpl’s report printing method, and to the PrintImpl’s report printing method itself.

The DonorLogImpl methods will traverse the singly linked list, starting at the top, using a for or while loop.Since this is an ordered list, when adding new nodes, the code will need to find the correct insertion spot that will maintain order by donor ids.The DonationLogImpl methods will use Iterator, as described in the textbook, to traverse the linked list.New MethodsAdd a traverseDisplay() method to both DonorLogImpl and DonationLogImpl. These methods will first display a header:Donor List: OR Donation List:and will traverse the list being implemented, using the toString() method to display each object in the list.Add a cleanUp() method to the Donor implementation to validate and clean up the donor list.Add a cleanUp() method to the Donation implementation to validate and clean up the donation list.Node ClassThe textbook refers to inner classes – you have probably not seen these yet. Inner classes allow you to include one class within another. Using the inner class, the textbook examples accessed attributes like thisSince all of the attributes were private, and within the parent class, it was possible to use the “dot” (.) notation to access the attributes.You will not do this. Instead of using inner classes, you will be creating your own Node class for the Donor’s singly linked list. Since the Node class will be a separate class, you will use getter/setter methods for access to private attributes. For example, using a Node class, the above code would be:Node&lt;String&gt; bob = new Node&lt;String&gt;(“Bob”);bob.setNext(harry.getNext()); // step 1harry.setNext(bob); // step 2A sample Node class for a singly linked list is shown in the linked list building example of the online Content in section 3.2.The main methodYou will start with the same main method that you used for Assn 2. After reading the data and creating the initial report, add the code to the end of the main method to: Display each list, using the traverseDisplay() methods. Clean up the lists. Create the second report.

HintsYour application should contain the following class source code files now: CS310&lt;lastname&gt;.java Node class for a singly linked list DonorListImpl – singly linked list of your implementation DonationListImpl –using java.util.LinkedList PrintImpl – same format as last week, but modified to use the linked listsDeliverables Your input data file will still be read from the input folder in your project.Place all test data files that you create to test your program in the input folder of your project, and name them as follows:assn3input1.txtassn3input2.txt(i.e. number each data file after the filename of assn3input.txt)Together, all of your test data files should demonstrate that you have tested every possible execution path within your code, including erroneous data which causes errors or exceptions. Your output data files will still be written to the output folder in your project. Create and/or modify Javadoc headers, and generate Javadoc files Add screen shots of clean compile of your classes to the documentation folder.WARNING: Submittals without the clean compile screenshots will not be accepted.Program SubmissionThis assignment is due by midnight of the date listed on the Course Assignments by Week page. Export your project from NetBeans, following the same steps used in Assns 1 &amp;2.o Name your export file in the following format: CS310&lt;lastname&gt;Assn&lt;x&gt;.zipFor example:CS310SmithAssn3.zipNOTE: Save this zip file to some other directory, not your project directory. Submit your .zip file to the Prog Assn 3 dropbox.Warning: Only NetBeans export files will be accepted. Do not use any other kind of archive or zip utility.Grading This program will be graded using the rubric that is linked under Student Resources page.WARNING: Programs submitted more than 5 days past the due date will not be accepted, and will receive a grade of 0.
